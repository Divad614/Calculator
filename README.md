# Calculator App

### About:

An HTML Based Calculator App, that use javascript to calculate the value shown on the input.

My inspiration came from the  Microsoft Calculator on the Windows operating system, it is very similar in design but the functionality differs.


### Features:

1.) It has BODMAS built into it and can use brackets in a equation.
2.) It can use keypresses as well as button clicks.
